# dailyplanner
I created a simple daily planner app where the user can save tasks for each hour of the day, using HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and JavaScript. I used additional methods including Moment.js, utilizing local storage, and bootsrap to bring the deployed site together. The main goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows people to type in events for time management purposes. 

Through the use of the Moment.js library, the current date is displayed on the page and the current time will appear when the user clicks the modal.
Additionally, through local storage, the user input gets saved to the console and persists when the webpage is refreshed.
